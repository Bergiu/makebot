آقای نخست وزیر مشروب نمی خورد
آقای نخست وزیر دود نمی کشد
آقای نخست وزیر در خانه ای حقیر اقامت دارد
ولی بیچارگان حتی خانه ی حقیری هم ندارند .

کاش گفته می شد :
آقای نخست وزیر مست است
آقای نخست وزیر دودی است
اما حتی یک فقیر میان مردم نیست.

Watashi’ll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi’ve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu’d before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker.

I know that Persian and Arabic is written in Arabic alphabets but I don't understand them. I just know that Persian is closer to english than it is to Arabic. So how should I know? And some things you write are Arabic to me😝
